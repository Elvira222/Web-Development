        <strong>Nobody’s born smart</strong>.<em> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.</em><br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything <em>at first</em></strong>.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
       <strong> Thankfully, we are born to learn</strong>.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying</em>. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
       <strong><em> Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.</em></strong><br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        <em>Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe</em><br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
